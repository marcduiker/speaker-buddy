# The Speaker Buddy System

This repository describes the Speaker Buddy System, an approach for conference speakers and organizers, to help each other out when technical issues arise, or when you need a friend who has your back.

## For conference speakers

Once the conference agenda is published and the Speaker Buddies are known, contact one of them (who does not speak at the same time as you!) to ask if they are willing to help you out, in case of technical issues / laptop failure. If they are, you can discuss the details such as:

- Having a copy of your presentation on their machine.
- Cloning your code repository on their machine, if you want to show code locally.
- Installing some SDKs & tools you need on their machine, if you want to run things locally.
- Is there any other way your buddy can help you out? Can they tell a funny story during the technical issue, or ask a relevant question, or do something else to put you at ease?

> Even with the existence of cloud-based coding environments, I still suggest to have a local environment available in case the internet connection is not good enough.

## For conference organizers

You can offer your speakers some peace of mind when they know someone has their back in case of technical difficulties (e.g. laptop failure).

### 1. CfP preparation

When preparing the Call for Papers (CfP), add a field to whatever system you're using to have the speaker indicate if they are willing to be a Speaker Buddy. Include a link to [this repo](https://github.com/marcduiker/speaker-buddy) so they can read more about it.

### 2. Speaker onboarding / confirmation

When onboarding/confirming speakers to your conference, mention the Speaker Buddy System and provide the list of speakers who have volunteered to be a Speaker Buddy.

Feel free to use this template in your communication:

Hi {speaker},

We highly encourage you to look for a Speaker Buddy before attending our conference.

A Speaker Buddy is another speaker that can help you out in case of technical issues (e.g. laptop failure).

These speakers are volunteering as Speaker Buddies:

Our conference agenda is published at {conference agenda url}, so look for a Speaker Buddy that is available during your session. 

It's best to prepare well in advance. For more information how to be prepared, read the tips at https://github.com/marcduiker/speaker-buddy.

### 3. Preparing the event location

When you prepare the conference rooms, label a front-row seat for the Speaker Buddy. This way they can help out the speaker quickly in case of technical issues.
