# Speaker Buddy ðŸŽ¶

## Background story
We all know and love the Christmas song 'Santa Baby' by Eartha Kitt (or Madonna, Kylie, Ariana etc.. pick your favourite!). During a conference in December where [Rick van den Bosch](https://github.com/rickvdbosch) and [Oscar van Tol](https://github.com/oscarvantol) were each other's speaker buddy, Rick had this song in his head and started replacing 'Santa Baby' with 'Speaker Buddy'. This got quickly followed by a 'hold my beer' from Oscar while he took out a notebook.  

> _Find a nice instrumental/karaoke version of Santa Baby to sing it to._

### [Verse 1]
```
Speaker buddy, can you clone this repository
For me?
Just to check if it builds.
Speaker buddy, be there on the first row today!
```

### [Verse 2]
```
Speaker buddy, a 50 slide powerpoint too
For you.
I just want to be sure.
Speaker buddy, be there on the first row today!
```

### [Chorus]
```
Think of all, that could go wrong
I've been thinking about the network, all along.
Every little thing will work as it should.
I just hope that the signal's strong.
```

### [Verse 3]
```
Speaker buddy, battery's low 
and my screen, will not show!
Have some cables for me?
Speaker buddy, be there on the first row today!
```

### [Verse 4]
```
Speaker buddy, another favor I wanted to ask
a task.
Take a photo of me?
Speaker buddy, be there on the first row today!
```

### [Verse 5]
```
Speaker buddy, I'm nervous for the dinner tonight
real fright.
Can you be someone I know?
Speaker buddy, be there on the first row today!
```

### [Chorus]
```
Come and see my pipelines break!
While everybody will think I'm fake!
I will also be there for you.
I'll calm your nerves on any mistake! 
```

### [Verse 6]
```
Speaker buddy, I hope all the demos will run
or one!
I do need WiFi for them.
Speaker buddy, be there on the first row today!
```

### [Outro]
```
Be there on the first row today!
Be there... room 8!
```
